# Capstone Project: Food-finder

Hello, this is the repository for my Capstone project I worked on as a fellow at The Data Incubator[Paste link here!]

---

## Objective:
To build recommendation system for a group of users and help them find a restaurant.

---
## Project genesis:
How often does it happen with you that you've got friends over and you all take forever to decide which place to go to? What are the plausible factors that prevent us from reaching a consensus? There could be several reasons: 
1. Every person has a **unique** taste.
2. People have constraints like **allergies**, **proximity** and so on
3. People have a craving for a certain food like **Chicken tikka** or **steak**

### Solution:
Having gone through this trouble with my roommates about a million times, I decided to solve this problem and the solution is in the form of Food-finder. 

---
## Key assumptions and details:
1. User(s) is(are) new to the platform.
2. They can select the cuisine from a wide variety of options available.
3. To build the system, data is taken from the Yelp dataset[link here!]
4. Restaurants are selected from the Greater Cleveland area.
5. More cities could be added in the future to get the top recommendations all over the US.
